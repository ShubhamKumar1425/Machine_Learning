📘 My Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository is where I’m collecting everything I learn in Machine Learning during my 6th semester. I’ll keep adding my daily progress here — whether it’s a small concept, a coding exercise, or something new I tried out.

I’m using this repo mainly to track my growth, stay consistent, and understand ML in a way that makes sense to me. Nothing too fancy — just my honest learning process.

🌱 What you’ll find here

My daily ML practice and notes

Python notebooks and experiments

Simple explanations written in my own words

Small projects as I improve

🎯 Why I made this

To keep myself motivated, organised, and to see how far I’ve come by the end of the semester.
